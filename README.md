# Air_Quality_Prediciton_Machine_Learning
This project analyzes the relationship between various air pollutants and the Air Quality Index (AQI). Using a dataset of daily air quality measurements from various cities, this project aims to predict the AQI bucket (e.g., "Satisfactory", "Moderate", "Poor") based on the concentrations of different air components.
